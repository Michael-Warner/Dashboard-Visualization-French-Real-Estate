Then set up the data in Tableau Desktop for the creation of interactive dashboards and to then publish it online

## Results:
The results that stand out, pre Covid, were there was a downward trend of sales after peaking in 2016. That being said, the overall price was increasing per apartment sale and somewhat flattening out for household sales.
